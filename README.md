# JMeter Analyzer

JMeter Analyzer is a Java-based tool designed to process and analyze performance test results generated by Apache JMeter. It provides consolidated performance summaries, generates CSV reports, and offers insights into test metrics such as response times, latencies, errors, and throughput.

## Features

- **CSV Report Generation**: Generate consolidated and individual CSV reports for performance metrics.
- **Performance Summary**: Print a detailed summary of test results to the console.
- **Docker Support**: Run the analyzer in a containerized environment using Docker and Docker Compose.
- **JMeter Integration**: Includes JMeter binaries for seamless test plan execution.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 17** or higher
- **Apache Maven** (for building the project)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for containerized execution)

## Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd JMeter_Analyzer
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

3. The JAR file will be available in the `target` directory:
   ```
   target/JMeter_Analyzer-1.0.jar
   ```

## Usage

### Running Locally

1. Execute the JAR file with the required arguments:
   ```bash
   java -Xmx1g -jar target/JMeter_Analyzer-1.0.jar <path-to-jmx-plans>
   ```

2. The results will be processed, and CSV reports will be generated in the specified output directory.

### Running with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t jmeter-analyzer .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/plans:/app/plans -v $(pwd)/results:/app/results jmeter-analyzer
   ```

3. The results will be available in the `results` directory.

### Running with Docker Compose

1. Start the service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. The results will be available in the `results` directory.
